### Project Description

We decided to develop a (borrowing) library system in python, that aims to bring the modern reader closer to the classical concept of the library and its administrator to its more flexible control. It also has the character of a social network, where the user communicates and is in contact with other users, makes friends and exchanges books.

### Use-Cases

1.  Book borrowing
2.  Return of Book
3.  Library Management
4.  Event Announcements
5.  Library Organization User
6.  Socialization of Readers
7.  Book Reviews & Recommendations
8.  Room Rent
